#
# Run the frontend test suite with awareness of a plugin's declared
# `disables` list (see doc/PLUGIN_FEATURE_DISABLES.md).
#
# A plugin that intentionally removes a baseline Etherpad feature MUST
# declare which feature tags it disables in its ep.json:
#
#   { "name": "ep_disable_chat", "disables": ["@feature:chat"], ... }
#
# This script enforces that contract with two passes:
#
#   1. Regression pass — every test NOT tagged with a disabled feature
#      must pass. Catches the case where the plugin breaks something
#      unrelated to the feature it claims to disable.
#
#   2. Honesty pass — every test that IS tagged with a disabled feature
#      must FAIL. If those tests pass, the plugin's `disables` claim is
#      wrong; the feature it says it disables actually still works.
#      Catches the case where a plugin opts out of tests it has no
#      right to skip.
#
# Both passes have to pass for CI to be green. A plugin can't quietly
# disable functionality without declaring it (pass 1 catches that), and
# can't quietly opt out of test coverage by declaring features it
# doesn't actually disable (pass 2 catches that).
#
# Usage:
#   bin/run-frontend-tests-with-disables.sh \
#     [--plugin-ep-json PATH] [-- <playwright args...>]
#
# Resolution order for the disables list:
#   1. EP_PLUGIN_DISABLES env var (comma- or space-separated)
#   2. --plugin-ep-json PATH (reads `.disables` JSON array)
#   3. Auto-detect: if exactly one ep_*/ep.json under plugin_packages/
#      declares disables, use it. Multiple disabling plugins → error.
#
# Run from src/ (where playwright.config.ts and node_modules live).
