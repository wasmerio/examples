# Runs each enabled downstream client from clients.json against an already-booted
# Etherpad: clone @ pinned ref, set up its toolchain, point it at core's freshly
# generated wire-vectors fixture, then run the client's vectorTest + smokeCmd.
#
# The fixture is injected via $ETHERPAD_WIRE_VECTORS (absolute) so clients test
# against CURRENT core's serialization, not their vendored snapshot. The smoke
# reaches the server via $ETHERPAD_SMOKE_URL + $ETHERPAD_SMOKE_APIKEY.

# Env (all optional except APIKEY):
#   SMOKE_URL      default http://localhost:9003
#   SMOKE_APIKEY   required for the live smoke (clients skip cleanly without it)
#   MANIFEST       default src/tests/downstream/clients.json (relative to repo root)
#   WIRE_VECTORS   default <repo>/src/tests/fixtures/wire-vectors.json
